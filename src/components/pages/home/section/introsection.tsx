            <p className="mb-6 text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
              I am a vocational high school student majoring in Software
              Engineering who underwent a Field Work Internship (PKL) at a
              software house as a Full-Stack Developer. During my internship, I
              was involved in developing web-based applications and had the
              opportunity to handle both the backend and frontend development
              processes.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-6 text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
              During my internship, I worked on various application features
              such as data management, user authentication, frontend-backend
              integration, and developing functional and responsive interfaces.
              This experience helped me understand the professional software
              development workflow, including the use of version control and the
              implementation of a clean and organized code structure.

              <strong> PHP (Laravel)</strong>, <strong>JavaScript (Vanilla, Node.js, React.js, Next.js,
              Astro)</strong>, <strong> HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, and <strong>SQL (MySQL)</strong> .
